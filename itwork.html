    <h2>DATA SCIENTIST</h2>
    <h3>What kind of work is done by data scientists and who they mostly interact with? </h3> <!--we might want to use h3 instead of p to make it stand out from the rest of the boxes.-->
    <p> In general, data scientists extract meaning from data, uncover insights and identify opportunities to inform business decision making as well as to gain more insights. </p>
    <p> Data scientists spend nearly 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data to improve its quality – i.e., make it accurate and consistent, before utilizing it for analysis. A data scientist can choose to have at least one among these 3 orientations: research-focused, business-focused, development-focused.</p
    <p> Research-focused data scientists usually work in long term projects and usually work with complex algorithms. Their jobs are transformation through development or implementation of new methodologies. They are required to have deep understanding of machine learning and statistics theories. They also need to get through research papers and really have good understanding of what is really going on. Usually for this position, a graduate degree in computer science is required. Research-focused data scientists will work will other scientists in different fields.  </p>
    <p> Business-focused data scientists usually work in short term projects involves predictive modelling, outcome measurement and insights. Their tasks aim for optimizing business outcomes through data-based discoveries. Different from the research-focused data scientists, business-focused data scientists need to have a good effective communication skill alongside with excel and power points. Business-focused data scientists will have to present their work to clients or big to medium corporates. They could also work along-side with marketing specialists and business developers.  </p>
    <p> Development-focused data scientists’ work is either developing machine learning, data pipelines, big data or the combination of all. To be able to successfully do their jobs, they are required to have a significant computer science knowledge, and very strong debugging skill. Development-focused data scientists work along with other data scientists to build good models. They usually work for data tech companies, especially those with centric products or data science focused line.  </p>
    <h3> What aspects of their position are most challenging?  </h3>
    <p> Common difficulties a data scientist may encounter: 
      <ul>
          <li> Data preparation 
              <p> Data scientists spend most of their time on cleaning and preparing data since these are the very first steps to begin with before analysis. However, a majority of scientists consider these jobs as the most boring, mundane part of their jobs. They are required to go through terabytes of data, across multiple formats, sources, functions, and platforms, on a day-to-day basis, at the same time keeping a log of their activities to prevent duplication. In order words, data scientists will have to find a way to overcome this repetition.  </p>
          </li>
          <li> Multiple data sources
              <p> To produce meaningful decisions, data scientists need to acquire data from different kinds of sources such as different types of apps and tools and generate different formats of data. Not to mention about the preciseness of each source, this process requires manual entry of data and time-consuming data searching, which leads to errors and repetitions, and eventually, poor decisions.  </p>
          </li>    
          <li> Data security
              <p> As organizations transition into cloud data management, problems arise. First, confidential data has become more vulnerable. Second, as a response to repeated cyberattacks, regulatory standards have evolved which have extended the data consent and utilization processes adding to the frustration of the data scientists. </p>
          </li>
          <li> Understanding the business problem
              <p> To build best solutions for the problems, data scientists must make sure they thoroughly understand the business problem. Failing this step, no matter how good the solutions sound like, they end up making no sense. However, most data scientists follow a mechanical approach to do this without clearly defining the business problem and objective. </p>
          </li>
          <li> Effective communication with non-technical stakeholders 
              <p> The lack of understanding of data science among management teams and stakeholders leads to unrealistic expectations on the data scientist, which affects their performance.   </p>

    <h2>IOS DEVELOPER</h2>
    <h3>What kind of work is done by iOS developer?  </h3>  <!--we might want to use h3 instead of p to make it stand out from the rest of the boxes.-->
    <p>iOS developers major work is to develop mobile applications for Apple’s iOS operating system using Swift programming language. </p>
    <p> Also, there are other work responsibilities can be assigned to iOS developers. For example, iOS developers are responsible for testing the app using unit testing, usability testing, and other types of testing that are needed to have a reliable and high-quality app. In addition, they are responsible for keeping the code maintained, organized, automated.  </p>
    <h3>What kinds of people does the iOS developer interact with?</h3>
    <p>iOS developers usually work in a team that include project manager, designers, and other iOS developers. </p>
    <h3>Where does the iOS developer spend most of their time?  </h3>
    <p>Apple developers as any other programmers spend much of their time coding and fixing bugs. </p>
    <h3>What aspect of the iOS developer position is most challenging?</h3>
    <p>There are many challenges that iOS developers face. App store approval is one of the most aspects that iOS developers find challenging. Apple has many rules and guidelines to accept an app in their app store and violating a minor rule might result in app rejection. Therefore, iOS developers should keep updated of Apple’s guidelines and rules and make sure they follow them before submitting their apps to be approved by AppStore. </p>
    <p>iOS application compatibility among different device sizes and different iOS versions is also another challenge that app developers commonly face. </p>

    <h2>CYBER SECURITY EXPERT</h2>
    <h3>What kind of work is done by Cyber Security Experts?</h3>
    <p>The main part of a Cyber Security experts' job is trying to stay one step ahead of cyber criminals.<br> 
        This involved tracking recent trends and methods used by cyber criminals and finding the best ways to defend from these attacks. <br> 
        There is also a lot of penetration testing where they will try to break into their own system to try to identify exploits and issues with their system and its defenses. <br> 
    </p>
    <h3>What kinds of people does the Cyber Security Expert interact with?</h3>
    <p>Cyber Security experts almost always interact with other IT professionals. <br>
       They will early interact with investors and the general public. <br>
       They may speak with clients if there has been a security breach and they intend to warn them or discuss helping them with cyber security. <br>
       Usually, they interact with other IT professions who delegate plans on cyber security, which they work on with other professionals, such as organising a penetration test, fixing exploits and report writing on their status to superiors. </p>
    <h3>Where does the Cyber Security Expert spend most of their time?</h3>
    <p>Cyber Security Experts spend most of their time doing penetration attacks on their own systems, they simulate real cyber security attacks to test the systems defensive capabilities. <br>
        They try to attack and access valuable information that a hack would be looking for. They often have a starting point of no privileges or the same as a regular employee to test different security levels. <br>
        Other people such as employees may also pose a risk, whether they know it or not, they may be the victim of a phishing attack and need to be educated by the Cyber Security Experts about it to avoid it. </p>
    <h3>What aspect of the Cyber Security Experts position is most challenging?</h3>
    <p>The most challenging part of being a Cyber Security Expert is being ahead of Cyber Criminals and taking measures to prevent cyber criminals from exploiting their security systems. <br>
        They must be aware of all the new methods and exploits used and how to best defend against them. <br>
        This can be time consuming and difficult to keep up with given the considerable number of cyber criminals and the variety of methods that they use. </p>
